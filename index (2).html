  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>We want to welcome you to this page and share why our family created this organization. When our beloved Tucker, whose life touched our entire family as a son, brother, uncle, nephew, and grandson, was murdered, we were suddenly thrown into a world we knew nothing about. Navigating the justice process was overwhelming and confusing, and we quickly realized that many families experienced the same uncertainty and lack of guidance.</p>

  <p>Through our journey, we learned how deeply people need support during painful and unfamiliar moments, and we want to be that source of help.</p>

  <p>This foundation was created in Tucker's honor and memory. He was a sweet, caring young man whose kind spirit touched everyone around him. It breaks our hearts that his compassion was taken advantage of, ultimately costing him his life. But even in our grief, we believe his legacy can be one of light, support, and dignity.</p>

  <p>Our mission is to walk beside families facing unimaginable trauma, helping them understand the justice process, and reminding them that they do not have to navigate it alone. We are also committed to serving those in our community who are often overlooked or forgotten, including individuals without basic necessities, support, or someone to simply acknowledge their worth. We want to help meet essential needs, provide comfort, and remind every person that they were created with dignity and deserve to be seen and cared for.</p>

  <p>As we support others, we will smile at the remembrance of Tucker, knowing that he and God are guiding our steps, leading us to help ease the burden of others.</p>

  <p>Thank you for being here. We look forward to growing, serving, and honoring Tucker's legacy together.</p>

    This organization exists because Tucker's life mattered and continues to matter. We remember him not only for the tragedy of his death, but for the kindness, compassion, and love he showed to others. Every act of support, every family we stand beside, and every need we help meet is part of the legacy he leaves behind.
